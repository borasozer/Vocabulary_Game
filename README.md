# Vocabulary_Game

The aim of this python programme is to create an application to help students learn vocabulary. In the application, there are 3 different games (Word Guess, Word Match and Letter Hunt), 5 different categories in each game (Maths, Science, History, Art, and Computer Science), 3 different difficulty levels in each category that the user can choose according to his/her level, and 3 levels to be played sequentially within each difficulty level.

Each level has 5 words and definitions. The user needs to guess these 5 words correctly and level up in order to progress in the game. When the user fails to complete 5 words or exits without completing them, progress does not record.

The application has a user login and stores the user's progress. In order to ensure friendly competition among students, lists ranked according to user score can be seen both within the whole application and on the basis of game, subject and difficulty level.

Apart from Python code, there are two different CSV files that store user data and words.
